## Design

The process was started by doing mockups of what I wanted my site to look like, keeping these ideas in
mind:
1/ Simple, uncluttered layout
2/ Good contrast between elements
3/ How will it code?

Just to start somewhere I used the breakpoints for the iPhone mini (2340 x 1080 pixels: iPhone 13 Mini
(2021), iPhone 12 mini (2020), iPhone 12 mini (2020) ) https://www.appmysite.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-iphone-screen-resolutions-and-sizes/

I used Canva https://www.canva.com/ for this and all my graphics, because I'm used to using it and it has
a resize feature with breakpoints showing.
This glossary was also a helpful guide to UX: https://www.appmysite.com/blog/ux-terms-glossary/

I wanted to find a way to bring header and footer bars into the design, and this seemed to have the
proportions I wanted

Colours: #737373 - Gray and #545454 - Dark Gray 2532x1170 px
Font from Canva for mockup

Mockups plus real blank different sizes

iPhone - the blue and white circles are placed there on my phone by Speechify which reads just the body
of the page

I resized for iPad Pro 12.9 2048x2732px - this is the other orientation but it has resized okay
